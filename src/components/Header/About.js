              Humans have been drinking alcohol for thousands of years. Alcohol
              is both a chemical and a psychoactive drug. In chemistry, an
              alcohol exists when a hydroxyl group, a pair of oxygen and
              hydrogen atoms, replaces the hydrogen atom in a hydrocarbon.
              Alcohols bind with other atoms to create secondary alcohols. These
              secondary alcohols are the three types of alcohol that humans use
              every day: methanol, isopropanol, and ethanol.
